## Uno Game (GUI) app
- First version of the game has released
## Running the project
Run the main class
/src/main/java/Main.java

## Description of the rules :
The game differs a little bit from the main real game Uno card game but in the next updates I will
add new rules that makes it exactly the same as the real Uno Card game

- In this game you play against the computer each player starts with 7 cards
and the purpose is finish all the cards you have. The game is basically based on luck and what
  kind of cards you get in the first distribution.
  The one who finishes his cards first , wins
  
There are three types of cards :
 1 - color cards : for example "Green 2" "Red 5" extra .. 
if there is card of the field for example "Red 5" you can put above the card either another card
that matches in color or in number , for example you can put "Red 9" or "Green 5"
---
 2 - Suspend cards : these cards you can put them on any kind of color or number and it suspends the turn of 
player after you
---
 3 - Joker cards : these cards sums for 4 cards for the next player to pick up if the player does not have
a defending cards that he has to pick up the sum of picks up cards (We will explain these terms in the next lines 
the sum of picks up cards , the defending cards):
----
 4 - Pay Cards : these cards sums for 2 cards for the next player to pick up if the player does not have
a defending cards that he has to pick up the sum of picks up cards , Pay cards need to be put on the right color for
example you can put "Green Pay" on "Green 4" or "Green 7" .in case you use a PAY card to defend
yourself You can put Pay card on different color or on Joker cards for example You can put "Red Pay" on "Green Pay"
or on "Joker"
---
5 - Demand cards : if you put the demand card . then you can request what color of card the next 
player has to put

---------
## Definitions:
1 - sums of picks up cards :
meaning that if a player attack the other player with Pay Card or Joker card each card in the attack 
sums with 2 or 4 cards
for example Joker card sums for 4 cards and Pay Card sums for 2 cards
2 - Defending card :
For example of the computer puts the Joker card , The sums starts for 4 cards. if you don't have a
defending card (Pay Card or Joker Card) then you will have to pick up four cards but if you have a Pay card for example
you can put it then the sums became 6 cards , the computer will have to pick up 6 cards if he does not have other defending card.

3 - out of choices:
this is a typical situation if you don't have any eligible card to be put on the field.
you automatically pick up one card . Same thing for the computer 


## Next updates

Will be coming in June and I will enhance the design of the game along with many other features
